# C++ Vector Data() Method and Undefined Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common C++ error involving the use of `std::vector::data()` and potential undefined behavior.  The code modifies a vector's elements via a raw pointer obtained from `data()`, then subsequently modifies the vector itself (by adding an element using `push_back`). This action is unsafe and can lead to unpredictable results.  The solution shows how to avoid this by ensuring that all operations involving the vector are performed in a safe and consistent way. 

## Bug Report

The primary issue lies in the direct manipulation of vector elements through a raw pointer after resizing the vector.  This violates the assumptions made by the `std::vector` implementation, resulting in undefined behavior. The behavior observed might range from seemingly correct results to crashes or memory corruption. 

## Solution

The solution provided avoids direct manipulation of vector elements through raw pointers after changing the vector's size or structure. Using iterators or array-like indexing operations within the boundaries of the vector is the recommended approach to achieve reliable and safe modification of vector elements.
